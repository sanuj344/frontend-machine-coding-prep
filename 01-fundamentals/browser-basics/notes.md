# Browser Basics

## How browser works
1. HTML is parsed into DOM
2. CSS is parsed into CSSOM
3. JS is executed
4. Render tree is created
5. Layout and paint

## DOM
- Document Object Model
- JS can manipulate DOM

## Event Handling
- click
- input
- submit

## Local Storage
- stores key-value pairs
- persists after refresh
